                <p>Education in Mexico has made great progress throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, but there is still much to do... </p>    
                    
    
                
                    <p><strong>What has been the progress of education in Mexico and what is its current situation?</strong></p> <!--Las etiquetas <strong> se usan para resaltar en negrita títulos o conceptos dentro de los párrafos y listas.-->

                        <p>During the last decades, progress has been made in terms of scope and coverage in the country, with the following figures: 98% of children between 6 and 11 years of age attend elementary school, 93% of young people between 12 and 14 years of age attend secondary school; where there are clear problems is in upper secondary education and preschool, only 73% of children between 3 and 5 years of age attend preschool and only 75% of young people between 15 and 17 years of age attend baccalaureate.

                        </figure>

                        <p>Currently, out of every 100 children who enter primary school, 80 continue on to secondary school (within the established time frame) and only 52 of these enter high school.</p>

                        <p>During the year 1960 the average schooling in people over 15 years old was from second grade of primary school (2.1 grades) to finished secondary school (9.1 grades) in 2015. This implies that during each decade that has passed it has been increasing by one grade level per decade. And similarly the illiteracy rate has been reduced from 12.4% in education over 15 years old in 1990 to only 5.5% in 2015.</p>

                        <p>Fifty-nine percent of children who graduate from primary school end up with deficient knowledge in mathematics and 49% in language. In addition, the PISA test shows that the majority of 15-year-old students score below in all areas. </p>

                        <p>The results indicate that progress in both science and reading has been nonexistent. Comparing results where in 2000 Mexican students scored 422 in both cases, while in 2015 the results were 423 in reading and 416 in science. On the other hand, progress in mathematics has been significant with an improvement of 21 points.</p>

                        <p>Similar to the situation of access to education, there is a difference between the inhabitants of highly marginalized areas compared to low marginalized areas; the difference between the quality of education of children in highly marginalized areas and those in low marginalized areas is approximately two years of schooling. Additionally, 80% of the children have insufficient learning, the above mentioned differences are also observed (although to a lesser extent) by income, undeserving population, rural population, parents' schooling and geographic location, conditioning the opportunities and the future of Mexican children. </p>
                    
                    <p>The current state of education prevents Mexican citizens from fully exercising their right to a quality education. </p>
